							cultivate a dynamic research and innovation ecosystem for the
							Creative Industries, propelling Ireland to the forefront of the
							sector and solidifying IADT as a global leader in creative
							research and innovation. With the support from the TU Rise
							programme, our initial emphasis will focus on Technology and
							Policy for the Creative industries, bolstered by overarching
							themes of sustainable innovation and Equality, Diversity, and
							Inclusion (EDI).

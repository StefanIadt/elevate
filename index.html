					<span class="elevate">ELEVATE</span> TEST is a dynamic 4-year
					initiative designed to strengthen the IADT Research and Innovation
					Office. ELEVATE’s primary goal is to cultivate a dynamic research and
					innovation ecosystem for the Creative Industries, propelling Ireland
					to the forefront of the sector and solidifying IADT as a global leader
					in creative research and innovation. With the support from the TU Rise
					programme, our initial emphasis will focus on Technology and Policy
					for the Creative industries, bolstered by overarching themes of
					sustainable innovation and Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI).

					Extending our specialist research focus, four “Creation Bridges” will
					transform our campus into a “live studio” in these areas:
				</h2>
				<p>
					A. Creation Bridge SCREEN – Growing IADT’s existing expertise in
					Animation, Expanded Screen Practices, Cyberpsychology, Creative
					Computing, AR/VR, Immersive Media Technologies, Gaming/Digital Content
					and Production.
				</p>
				<p>
					B. Creation Bridge DESIGN – consolidate IADT’s expertise in
					Communication, Information, Strategic and Organisational Design, 3D
					Design, UI/UX, Spatial, Speculative, Environmental Design, Visual
					Arts, Critical Design Approaches, Design Thinking and Artistic
					Research.
				</p>
				<p>
					C. Creation Bridge POLICY – Promoting evidence-based research,
					informing and shaping political and civic debate on the social and
					economic impacts of policy on the Creative and Cultural Sector and
					Industries (CCSI), culture and society, through the lens of EDI, human
					interaction, the Social Sciences, thought Leadership and Strategic
					Planning. This virtuous RDI ecosystem is fully integrated with our
					strategy, enabling IADT to place research at the epicentre of its
					activities. It reflects IADT ethos and vision which is guided by the
					transformative potential for creative and critical practices to
					release original ideas about how we understand the world now, and in
					the future. It capacitates IADT to deliver on its stated mission to
					re-model and revolutionise the future of the Creative Industries.
				</p>
				<p>
					D. Creation Bridge GROW — is the research growth, training, engagement
					and impact engine, which will host our academics, teams of
					researchers, and a suite of training packages, and develop networks
					for our Academic Residency and Industry Fellowship programmes to seed
					and grow the next areas of specialisations.
				</p>
				<p>
					These bridges are gateways and generators to other areas of research
					specialisation and expertise, and they coalesce as a force for
					positive social change.
				</p>
				<footer>
					Ethical screen practices and responsible content creation produce
					beneficial outcomes for society, forging pathways to a more cohesive
					future. Critical design methodologies lever imaginative and daring
					problem-solving approaches to the biggest challenges facing society,
					such as Climate Change. Creative approaches to leadership produce an
					informed and persuasive model for policy making, impacting significant
					challenges facing the CCSI in such areas as EDI and Sustainability.
					The foundation for nurturing, and shaping the above, is IADT’s
					demonstrable excellence in Psychology, Technology and Critical
					Humanities research in Art, Design, Performance, Screen and Textual
					Histories and Theories, Visual, Material, Public and Popular Cultures.
					This transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and profoundly
					collaborative ecosystem is powered by the multifaceted and nuanced
					approaches emancipated when rigorous creative practices and critical
					research combine.
